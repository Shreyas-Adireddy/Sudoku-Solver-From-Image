# SudokuSolverFromImage
If you give it an image, it will solve the sudoku board built into that image. The solving algorithm uses backtracking and is located in the solver.py file. The Machine Learning is located in the sudoku_img_finder.py file where it uses a pretrained file model-OCR.h5 to check for digits in the sudoku board. 
# Instruction
Run the sudoku_img_finder.py! If you want to try it with a different image, go into the file and replace sudoku1.jpg with the name of your image (make sure the image is in the same directory).
